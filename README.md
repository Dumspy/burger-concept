# A simple website for reviewing burger places
## Based of an assignment description
You are working on a new social platform for burger fanatics where users can review local burger places, scoring them based on taste, texture and visual presentation. The users are also able to upload a picture of their burgers, in order to entice fellow burger fanatics.

On the platform, the user is also able to find nearby restaurants with burgers on the menu, read information about location and opening times. The new Burger Backend 1.0â„¢ (trademark pending) is designed to be consumed on multiple platforms, both mobile and web. Design the architecture and implement the endpoint.

We do not expect a fully functioning application. It is ok to stub parts of the application in order to focus on other aspects that you think show of your skillset better.

The assignment creates a base of discussion for the interview. We do not expect you to use more than 10-15 hours on the task.
